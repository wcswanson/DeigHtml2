		<h2>DEIG chatter from the DEIG e-mails</h2>
		<em>Please feel free to call the DEIG Hot Line <b>(207-479-1779)</b> about meetings or especially if you need help.</em><br />
		<p>
			I know a couple groups that have switched to Zoom meetings.  We are sharing numbers through local groups and contacts.  
			I&#39;ve attended a couple and they've worked well.  The Step Sisters purchased a Zoom plan that allows for longer meetings.  
			The free version only allows you 40 minutes for groups larger than 3, so we had a minute break and then sent around another link.  
			We are willing to allow other groups to use our plan so they can set up their own meetings.  And we're meeting every other day 
			instead of twice a week.  So we're trying.
		</p>
		<a href="./PDFs/ZoomMeetings.jpg" target="blank">The list from this conversation</a> (Right click -- select save list as...)<br />
		<a href="./PDFs/AA-Meetings-online.pdf" target="blank">AA Meetings on-line</a><br />

		<p>
			I think if groups are willing to share the zoom link and schedule we could post it.  I think just like any meeting; the group 
			should have a consistent schedule before we post it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I had a friend post this about nationwide zoom meetings. There&#39;s a couple NA, not sure if we can edit those out, 
			or be lenient in this time and include them.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are purchasing a Zoom account for district 18.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our groups will share the login so we can set up a schedule of meetings hosted by the different groups. 
			I will keep you all posted as meeting numbers and such things are developed. Nothing to report right now.
		</p>
		<p>
			More will be revealed, but people are connecting. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are some thoughts around our possible responsibilities as one of the meeting list providers. Can we start an email thread for sharing our thoughts?
			I know we are all dealing with many aspects of the current shift, so any consideration, in your own time, will be welcome.

	<h2>Grapevine and La Viña are here to help</h2>
	<p>Due to the current changing health situation, many AA meetings across the U.S. and Canada are finding it safer to close. To help members during this time, 
		we are giving everyone <a href="https://www.aagrapevine.org/we-are-here-to-help" target="blank">free access</a> to all of our 2020 Grapevine and La Viña issues. (The audio to Grapevine’s stories will be available as well, so people 
		can listen to the stories if they like.) Please share with your fellows. We have also included a link to our Youtube channel with some original audio stories 
		as well as other important information.
